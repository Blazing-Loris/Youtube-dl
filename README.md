 # Youtube-dl
 ## Know something that youtube-dl does?  Well, Chip in!

 So I was going through the documentation of youtube-dl and as it turns out it can do a plethora of things!
 Sadly none of them are explicitly mentioned on the web and it's a pain in the ass to go through the documentation everytime if you want to do something new.

 So I thought why not make a repository that will contain **every thing youtube-dl is capable of doing** explicitly with instructions so people don't have to browse the web endlessly.
 
 This is the first time I am doing any project on Github so suggestions on how I should go about or how the project must be structured are most welcome. :)
